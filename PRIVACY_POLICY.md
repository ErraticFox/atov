# Privacy Policy for AtoV

**Last Updated:** January 17, 2026

## Introduction
AtoV ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension designed to help users automate interactions with the Amazon A-to-Z employee portal. We define "user" as any individual using this extension.

## Data Collection and Usage
**We do not collect, transmit, or sell any of your personal data.**

The extension operates entirely locally on your device.

## Data Storage
The extension uses the local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your settings and preferences, such as:
- Shift times
- VTO target parameters (dates, times, durations)
- Automation state (running/stopped)

This data is stored solely on your browser and is not synced to any external servers or third-party services.

## Third-Party Access
Since we do not collect data, we do not share any data with third parties. The extension interacts with `atoz.amazon.work` purely to perform the automation tasks you have configured.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of this policy.

## Contact
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store support tab.
